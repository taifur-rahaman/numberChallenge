# Number Challenge

**Instructions:**

> Generate a variable called `a` that is a random number between 1 and 100.

> Create a variable called for the sum, difference, product, quotient and remainder of `x` and `y`. Show the output in a string that shows the two numbers of `x` and `y` along with the operator and result.

**Expected Result:**

```javascript
console.log(sumOutput); // 31 + 15 = 46
console.log(differenceOutput); // 31 - 15 = 16
console.log(productOutput); // 31 * 3 = 93
console.log(quotientOutput); // 30 / 3 = 10
console.log(rmOutput); // 31 % 15 = 1
```
